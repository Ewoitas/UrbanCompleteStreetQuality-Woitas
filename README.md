# UrbanCompleteStreetQuality-Woitas

Project Overview:

In this project, the "Complete Street Quality" of three primary transit Urban Boulevards in Calgary was assessed. These Urban Boulevards were assessed based on metrics of Walkability, Urban Realm Quality, and Multimodality. These metrics were converted into qualtifiable attributes which include the following: 

Wide Sidewalks (2.5m or more), Complete Walking Connections, Unimpacted Pedestrian Travel, Green Buffering, Integrated Land Use, Dedicated Space for Rapid Transit, and Dedicated Bike Infrastructure. 

The block space of each Urban Boulevard was assessed, and was broken into 0.5m segments for analysis. These segments were then averaged for each criteria to produce a final "Completeness" score. This analysis assesses the sustainability of Calgary based on how well Urban Boulevards are designed to suit the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users, as well as how well these streets have been retrofitted to conform to policy guidance.
